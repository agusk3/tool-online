     * Multiple IPs
     *
     * You can enable this option if you are having problems with youtube IP limit / IP ban.
     * This option will work only if the IP you add are available for the server.
     * That means you have to buy some additionnal public IPs and assign these new static IPs to the server.
     * This should work only if you have a dedicated server...
     *
     *
     * Example of adding additional IPs to Ubuntu server 14.04 LTS
     * !!!! Be very careful, you may block yourself !!!!
     * !!!! If you are connecting to your server remotly by ssh. You would do this only if you know what you do !!!!
     * !!!! This is only an example with a specific dedicated server (ovh.net) !!!!
     *
     * For this example, the main IP on the server is 123.456.789.001
     * We want to add additionnal IPs 789.456.123.001 and 789.456.123.002
     *
     * Edit /etc/network/interfaces and put something like this:
     *
     * # The loopback network interface
     * auto lo
     * iface lo inet loopback
     *
     * # The Main server IP:
     * auto eth0
     * iface eth0 inet static
     *     address 123.456.789.001
     *     netmask 255.255.255.0
     *     network 123.456.789.0
     *     broadcast 123.456.789.255
     *     gateway 123.456.789.254
     *
     * # Additionnal IP: 789.456.123.001
     * auto eth0:0
     * iface eth0:0 inet static
     *     address 789.456.123.001
     *     netmask 255.255.255.255
     *     broadcast 789.456.123.001
     *     gateway 123.456.789.254
     *
     * # Additionnal IP: 789.456.123.002
     * auto eth0:1
     * iface eth0:0 inet static
     *     address 789.456.123.002
     *     netmask 255.255.255.255
     *     broadcast 789.456.123.002
     *     gateway 123.456.789.254
     *
     * # Additionnal IP xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
     * auto eth0:2
     * iface eth0:2 inet static
     * (...)
     *
     * and so on for each IP you want to add....
     *
     *
     * Reboot your server
     * If you are having trouble and cannot connect anymore over ssh to your server,
     * that means your new network configuration has errors...
     * So be very careful before applying your configuration.
     * Try it first on a local dev server before messing up with your pro server.
